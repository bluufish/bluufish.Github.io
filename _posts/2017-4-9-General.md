title: AirBNB Amsterdam Analysis
published: true
---

The first project I worked on at General Assembly was analyzing host data from AirBNB and it was my introduction to the complete process of Data Analysis. 

The data was gathered from publicly sourced AirBNB data available from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

AirBNB is an online marketplace which enables people to lease or rent out their homes while not requiring the property owners to have any formal training or a business license. This ease of entry into the market has created its own boom in short-term rental properties while also building up its own pile of legal issues. The goal of this project was to perform an analysis of the AirBNB market in Amsterdam using Excel for a hypothetical client who wanted to invest in property to rent out using AirBNB. 

As my first project, I went through all the steps a data analyst would go through by following the analytical process.

This involved figuring out the problem we're trying to solve, gathering the data needed to solve it, cleaning and organizing data which involved creating strategies for dealing with null values, analyzing it and then finally preparing it for presentation. The thing I find most interesting about Data Analysis is the fact that in situations, you figure out what problem you want to solve before you even have the data. Its similar to cooking in that you generally decide what you want to cook and then buy the ingredients you need. Of course you can cook with what you have on hand and its also the case that you can identify problems that need solving just from looking at data.

After cleaning up the data, we were tasked with the challenge of figuring the revenue that each host brought in. Data on the exact revenue each host made or their guest count was not publicly available so we used nested if functions to estimate the daily revenue based off the review count, rates, and accomodation capabilities.
