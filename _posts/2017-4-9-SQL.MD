SQL Sequel and Firefox

My second project at General Assembly involved learning how to use queries in SQL to aggregate data from a Mozilla Firefox beta test called a Test Pilot. There were some challenges at first from going to Excel to SQL since SQL was language based and had no interface and a limited UI. But as I used SQL, I quickly fell in love with the freedom and the creativity that was allowed when writing your own queries to find exactly what you were looking for. One part I didn't love though was the preciseness of Syntax as I had had queries broken by single misplaced punctuation but that was the tradeoff.

The second project at General Assembly had a very clear objective which was to argue if developers should focus on Bookmarks function or the Tab function. As you're reading this blog, you probably have several tabs of your own opened and are already forming your own opinions on this or maybe imagining a time when we didnt even have tabs. The data we were provided with was surveys filled out by the test users and a record of all of their actions from opening windows to even clicking links. When I looked at the data however, it was much different from the straight forward excel sheets I had been studying up until now because this data required a key to decipher it.
