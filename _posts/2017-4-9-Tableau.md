My introduction to Tableau and the horror that is Restaurant Inspection Health Grades

My third and final project at General Assembly didnt come with a topic but instead we were to look for our own data, get it approved and basically figure out what we want to do with it. It was quite an interesting experience seeing all the data that was publically available on the net and finding out what interested me. Originally I wanted to do AirBNB again except with the Tokyo market since I've used AirBNB in Tokyo but the data was either insufficient or was not publically available which led me to the frustration of not finding the data I wanted. Ultimately at the recommendation of the instructors, I decided to browse New York City's [own publically available database](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) for interesting topics. Seeing our city full of looming skyscrapers deconstructed down into spreadsheets was very enjoyable. From transportation, to schools, to business and everything about zoning regulation you never cared about, it was all available at the click of my mouse. I settled on the thing thats been staring at me my entire life, which were all the restaurants with all the B Sanitary Inspection grades near my house. How bad is a B exactly and what does it mean? Does the city have a problem with Bs or is it certain areas or just certain restaurants? All these questions suddenly rushed into my head as I downloaded the data provided by the DOHMH in their New York City Restaurant Inspection Results report.
