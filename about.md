My name is Simon Chan and I'm born and raised in Brookyln. I'm kind of a shut-in but on the internet I have my own anonymous following. I've always wanted to work in Japan and even spent close to a year living there, becoming fluent in Japanese during that time and going on many adventures; however, that adventure didn't work out and I decided to pursue an actual career in the meantime. This led me to discovering the world of Data Analysis and attending General Assembly, a technical college where individual can train in valuable technology skills that are in demand. Although I am still an amateur when it comes to Data Analysis, its a passion that I hope will lead me to great heights.

### Also about me

My hobby is collecting large amount of books that I dont read and building bookshelves to hold them. I mostly collect manga and Japanese language reference books. I enjoy learning how to fix things and buying the tools I need for the job. My motto is look before you leap and I am always prepared for any situation with a manbag filled with all sorts of tools from a power back to a screw driver to high duty earplugs.
