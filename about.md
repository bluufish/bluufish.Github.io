My name is Simon Chan and I'm born and raised in Brookyln. I'm kind of a shut-in but on the internet I have my own anonymous following. I've always wanted to work in Japan and even spent close to a year living there, becoming fluent in Japanese during that time and going on many adventures; however, that adventure didn't work out and I decided to pursue an actual career in the meantime. This led me to discovering the world of Data Analysis and attending General Assembly, a technical college where individual can train in valuable technology skills that are in demand. Data Analysis has changed the way I view the world and how I have come to perceive it. In a way everything we do is Data Analysis since we take information that we gather and then use it to get what we want. Its taught me to be goal oriented and objective focused in life and to approach everything with a process in mind. Although I am still an amateur when it comes to the technical aspects of Data Analysis, its a passion that I hope will lead me to great heights. 

### Also about me

My hobby is collecting large amount of books that I dont read and building bookshelves to hold them. I mostly collect manga and Japanese language reference books. I enjoy learning how to fix things and buying the tools I need for the job. My motto is look before you leap and I am always prepared for any situation with a manbag filled with all sorts of tools from a power back to a screw driver to high duty earplugs. I am probably the pickiest eater I know and you should never ask me out to coffee because I dont drink it. I've accidentally stated on a survey once that my dislikes were people and cheese.
